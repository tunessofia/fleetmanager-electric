## About

Small POC for rendering a google maps, with a predefined route for an electric vehicle, showing the relevant charging stations along the way

- The App renders a Map with the Departure marker, Arrival marker and best route from Lisbon Airport to the AutÃ³dromo Internacional do Algarve. 
- The App only renders the relevant Charging Stations along the way
- The App provides a way for the user to select only the Fast Charging Stations
- The user is able to visualize the Charging Station information - Address, socket type and number of sockets ðŸ”Œ

This poc also uses a dummy backend server, found in the backend/ folder built to load some static info about the charging stations, so a call to an api could be simulated.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`
